Author's Note: **This map can be VERY resource intensive, Server OPs beware.**

=========Briefing=========

Discontinued GDI funding and a large scale NOD offensive
has left GDI forces in the sector in a critical state of
neglect.

NOD forces have overrun and captured the main GDI base in
the area leaving on a small damaged outpost the only
remaining base under GDI control in the sector.

Defend the remaining base from all attacks until an assault
on the NOD base can be mounted. Eliminate all NOD forces.

*END TRANSMISSION*

=========OBJECTIVES=========

* Build your Base and purchase upgrades to help fortify your position.
* Hold out until help arrives.
* Destroy the NOD base within the area.

+ Remember

* If you lose your Refinery or the Barracks, they will be gone forever.
* If your Construction Yard is destroyed, your mission will be a failure.
+ Tips

* Teamwork is extremely important for an effective team on this map.
* Wait for everyone to connect and decide a strategy at the lobby before you start the map.
* It's good practice to give people roles for both waves and rest periods. Have designate people to collect Tiberium, others to build or repair.
* Be very efficient with your time during the rest periods. Every second counts to recover and strengthen your defenses.
* Getting Carry Capacity and Repair Wrench upgrades from the Barracks are a  good first priority.
* Be careful with your credit spending, you may ran out of money when most you need it.

=========Known Issues========= 

**This map can be VERY resource intensive, Server OPs beware.**

Due to the finicky nature of Goldsrc there may be some Janky-ness such as NPC rockets Phasing through buildings, NPC path finding and attacking being weird at times, occasional server hitching, and other weirdness that I couldn't troubleshoot. If you have any issues with the map of have any questions you can @ me on the Sven Co-op discord mappers channel.
